      "text": "Opened by masters with over 40 years of experience, VKUS 5+ is not just an ordinary burek shop - it's a story woven from tradition, decades of dedicated work, effort, and lots of dough. Since July 2020, in the midst of the global pandemic until today, every baking tray tells a craft story of kneading and daily shaping.<break/>With us, nothing is rushed - each layer is precisely hand-stretched, every filling prepared with care, each tray shaped and baked with soul, every oven smells like home, every bite full of freshness and crispness. This quality isn't accidental - it's decades of dedication, patience, and craftsmanship nurtured over time, proudly shared today with all who know what real good burek means. <break/>VKUS 5+ isn't just a place to eat, but an experience that will awaken all your senses and prove that authentic taste still exists - you just need to find it in the right place, as locals say <emphasis><strong>You really are VKUS five plus!</strong></emphasis>",
